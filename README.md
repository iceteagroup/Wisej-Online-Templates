## How to get support

## How to renew your account

You will receive an automated notification and an invoice right before the expiration of your Technology Partner account with us. The best way to renew the account is simply to pay the invoice :slightly_smiling_face:.

You can terminate the Technology Partner account at any time by creating a new issue or by sending us an email directly. Terminated accounts will _not_ generate a refund and will lose access to the private repository as well as the Wisej source code (if enabled).

Please note that your Wisej licenses are perpetual, but you will not be able to use Wisej releases after the natural end of the Technology Partner period.

## How to change your license count

Create a [new issue](../../issues/new/choose) and select the template **License Report**. The issue will be logged and processed quickly. However, you don't need to wait for our confirmation to use the additional licenses - they are available to you immediately.

The license change will be reflected in this page and you will receive an invoice for the license **increase** prorated amount to the next renewal date. Please note that a license **decrease** will _not_ generate a credit, but it will reduce the amout of the next renewal.

## How to access the source code

If you have activated access to the [Wisej source code repository](http://github.com/iceteagroup/Wisej), you can read all issues logged in relation to the Wisej source code and you can fork the full library into a designated user account. You will also be able to change your fork of the Wisej source code and log pull requests.
